# README

Welcome to my sandbox, a contacts register.

I use Ruby on Rails v7.1.2
And some gems so don't forget:
- bundle install

There are 2 users with a total of fifty contacts between them.

1. rails db:create
2. rails db:migrate
3. rails db:seed

You will find the credentials in the seed.rb file.
